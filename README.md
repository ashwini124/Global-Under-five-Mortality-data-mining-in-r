# Global-Under-five-Mortality-data-mining-in-r-
This repository presents a comprehensive study on the global crisis of under-five age mortality rates, with a focus on analyzing the influence of various factors on child mortality rates across different continents using R.


# Key Findings:
- The analysis reveals that the impact of different factors on child mortality rates varies significantly across continents.
- Notably, there is a strong positive correlation between the literacy rate of adult females and under-five mortality rates.
- Open defecation has a highly negative effect on child mortality rates.
- Privatization of healthcare systems suggests that investment in education, increasing awareness, may be more effective in reducing mortality rates compared to direct investment in healthcare.
- Adequate nutrition and access to clean water are crucial factors affecting child mortality rates in specific continents.
- The findings emphasize the importance of educational programs and public health interventions focused on birth spacing as highly effective strategies in reducing child mortality rates.


# Methods Used:
The analysis involved performing multiple linear, random forest, and support vector machine regression techniques to examine the influence of different factors on child mortality rates.
